## [Unreleased]

## [2.2.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- Crash dumps for dying sessions: when a session transitions to `error`, fleet writes a forensic snapshot to `~/.config/fleet/crashes/<id>_<ts>.txt` containing the tmux exit status/signal (with human-readable annotation — e.g. `9 (SIGKILL — likely OOM/Jetsam or external kill)`), last 200 lines of pane content (raw ANSI), the SessionEnd hook reason from Claude Code, and the last 6 perfwatch heartbeats — enough to tell a kernel kill from a panic from a clean exit at a glance. Tmux now uses `remain-on-exit on` so dead panes can be inspected before fleet cleans them up. Perfwatch heartbeats also gained a `sys_free_mb` field (system-wide free memory) so the heartbeat trail records memory-pressure collapse leading up to a crash.
- `FLEET_AUTO_UPDATE_DISABLED=1` env var to skip the auto-updater on a per-launch basis (handy when running a local dev build you don't want overwritten by the latest release)
- Storm detector in perfwatch: dumps a snapshot when sustained Update() throughput exceeds 200/s, catching tea.Cmd loops that flood the loop without any single Update going slow (the stall watchdog can't see those)
- Per-repo `pr_checks.ignore` config in `.fleet.json` / `.fleet.local.json` (path.Match globs) to drop noisy CI checks like gitstream's `minimum-review/default_reviewers` from the PR-badge rollup, so a single non-actionable failure no longer turns the whole badge red.

### Fixed

- Status flickering between `waiting` and `running` while navigating Claude's AskUserQuestion dialog
- Restarting a dead session no longer briefly flashes back to `error` (with a misleading crash dump) before the new Claude process fires its first hook. Restart now clears the previous Claude's hook state — both in memory and the on-disk status file — so the worker doesn't trust an 8-minute-old `status=dead` during the relaunch window. The crash-dump quota also re-arms when a fresh hook reports the session is alive again, so a real death following a false-positive flash still produces a dump.
- TUI freezing for ~500ms when the 5-second undo-delete window expired while scrolling — the tmux kill now runs off the Update loop

## [2.1.0] - 2026-05-07

### Added

- PgUp / PgDn navigate the sidebar by a full page; cursor stays in view at list edges

## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added

- AI-powered PR review config via CodeRabbit: `.coderabbit.yaml` tunes the reviewer for Go (chill tone, golangci-lint + gitleaks wired in, path instructions that flag Bubble Tea anti-patterns and public-repo workflow hazards). Once the CodeRabbit GitHub App is installed on the repo, every PR gets an auto-generated walkthrough and inline review comments. Free for public repos — contributors don't need anything set up on their side.

### Improved

- Worktree dialogs now guide you toward a valid git branch name as you type: spaces become `-`, and chars git forbids anywhere (`~ ^ : ? * [ \` and control chars) are dropped live. Rules that can't be fixed silently (leading `-`, `..`, trailing `.lock`, etc.) show a friendly inline error on submit instead of a cryptic `git worktree add` failure.

### Changed

- **Renamed `brizz-code` to `fleet`.** Binary, config dir, tmux prefix, env vars, Chrome native messaging host, and Homebrew formula all renamed:
- Binary: `brizz-code` → `fleet`
- Config dir: `~/.config/brizz-code/` → `~/.config/fleet/`
- Tmux prefix: `brizzcode_` → `fleet_`
- Env vars: `BRIZZCODE_INSTANCE_ID` → `FLEET_INSTANCE_ID`, `BRIZZ_DEBUG` → `FLEET_DEBUG`, `BRIZZ_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` → `FLEET_TELEMETRY_DISABLED`, `BRIZZ_DEMO_PREFIX` → `FLEET_DEMO_PREFIX`
- Per-repo workspace config: `.fleet.json` / `.fleet.local.json` (legacy `.bc.json` / `.bc.local.json` still read for compatibility)
- NMH manifest: `com.brizzai.fleet.tabcontrol.json`
- Homebrew: `brew install brizzai/tap/fleet`
**Auto-migration on first launch:** existing `~/.config/brizz-code/` is moved to `~/.config/fleet/`, live `brizzcode_*` tmux sessions are renamed to `fleet_*`, and stale `brizz-code hook-handler` entries are stripped from `~/.claude/settings.json`. Legacy `BRIZZ*` env vars are accepted as fallback for one release window so in-flight Claude processes survive the upgrade. The Chrome extension keeps the same extension ID (stable via `key` in manifest), so no reinstall is needed.
To upgrade from `brizz-code`:
```bash
brew uninstall brizz-code
brew install brizzai/tap/fleet
```
Or run `fleet` directly — the migration shim handles config moves, tmux session renames, and hook cleanup transparently.

### Fixed

- Status detection: sessions in extended thinking mode (with `· ↓ tokens · thinking with high effort` format) now correctly stay "running" instead of oscillating between running/finished every 10 seconds.
- Status detection: hook events now reflect in the TUI within ~100ms (was 4–6s, waiting on the worker's round-robin). Stale "running" hooks no longer oscillate between idle/running/finished on pane-content changes (survey popups, cursor blinks, scrollback redraws).

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-15

### Added

- RTS-style session hotkeys: bind the selected session to a numbered slot with `Alt+0-9` (or `=` then a digit), jump with plain `0-9`, double-tap within 400ms to also attach. Unbind by re-pressing `Alt+<N>` on the already-bound session, or `==` then the digit to clear any slot. Bound sessions show a `[N]` badge in the sidebar and persist across restarts.
- Undo delete (z key): restore deleted sessions within 5 seconds. Sticky repos: empty repo groups persist in sidebar until dismissed.

### Fixed

- Fatal "concurrent map read and map write" crash caused by unlocked reads of the git info cache during render
- Status detection: sessions with `hook=finished` no longer flap between "running" and "finished" during active sub-agent work. `applyHookFinished` now corroborates pane-detected "finished" with tmux window activity — if the pane was written to in the last 3 seconds, hold the previous state instead of flipping.
- Status detection: permission menus where the cursor is on option 2 or 3 (not just option 1) are now correctly detected as "waiting" instead of flipping the session to idle.
- Status detection: sessions running Explore sub-agents (with the `· ↑ tokens` output counter) stay marked as "running" instead of collapsing to "idle" when a stale waiting hook is in play.
- Status detection: idle sessions no longer get stuck at "running" when their scrollback contains text that mentions the whimsical token counter (e.g. commit messages or docs referencing `· ↓`/`· ↑` + `tokens`).

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-09

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added

- Agent team status detection: sub-agent permission prompts and "Waiting for team lead approval" now correctly show as waiting
- Command palette (`:` or `Ctrl+P`) — fuzzy-searchable list of all actions with shortcut hints, plus "Reload All Sessions" for bulk restart of dead/error sessions
- Terminal environment and rendering stats in bug reports to help diagnose scroll/rendering issues

### Improved

- Status updates now respond in ~150ms instead of up to 2s via event-driven hook notifications

### Fixed

- Agent team sessions showing idle/running instead of waiting when sub-agent needs approval
- Bug report dialog freezing permanently when `gh` CLI is not installed
- "Last used" time now updates on all interactions (approve, restart, new prompt), not just attach
- Status showing stale data immediately after detaching from a session
- Status oscillating between idle and finished when stale waiting hook is present
- Session stuck at "waiting" status after user interrupts/escapes a permission prompt
